Homework03 Evaluation
======================

You did pretty OK on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

There were some problems.  First, it was hard to tell which file
was for which problem.  I had to search for "main(" to find what
to run.  That didn't cost you any points, though.

The string hash table worked for creation and insertion and did
the linear probing correctly for insertion, but deletion didn't
find repeated values in the linear probe so it would fail.  Find
would also fail for the same reason.

HashTableFoldingApp would not work.  No matter what I entered for
key, it would blow up with a NumberFormatException.  I gave you
1/2 credit for those because you wrote the code, but it doesn't
work.  I was using 200 for the size, but when I did a "show" it
only showed me two slots.

HeapApp didn't really work very well either.  It goes into an
infinite loop when you enter "show".  I can't tell if it is
inserting or deleting on those operations.  Change is impossible
to tell what the proper key is; for example trying to change the
"50" to something else tells me it's invalid but gives me no
indication of the range.

These were from Trevor's repo.

Total credit is 33 points
-------------------------

you got 25 out of 30 which is 83.33% which is a B-minus
but I'll round it up to an 84 so you have a solid B.
