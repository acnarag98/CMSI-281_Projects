======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Good job on the sorting routine.  I like the tests you put in
so that you are covering some of the edge cases using the values
that you previously sorted, simply adding on new values and re-
sorting the entire thing.  Good job checking negative numbers,
too.

The Simon game works, and it's a novel approach.  Not QUITE what
was called for, but not too far out.  I like the idea of the levels
but I was able to cheat by pressing caps lock, then pressing each
letter in turn as it appeared.  The letters got buffered, so when
it was time for me to enter my guess, they were already there in 
the correct order.  *grins and winks*  Old hacker trick....

The game is actually supposed to put up one color, then have me
guess it, then two colors, have me guess those, then three colors,
and so on, until I make a mistake with my guesses.  It should be
continuing like that until the user screws up.  At that point,
the game should ask if I want to play again, and if I say "yes",
it should clear everything out, get a new list of letters, and
start over.

Your code does look nice, though.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 12 out of 13 which is 100% which is an A-plus
