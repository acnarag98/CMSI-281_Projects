======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

There is a similar way to use a FileReader and BufferedFileReader as
you have done in the TargetFile.java code with FileWriter.  Check the
Java API for more details or just search on "reading files in java"
for more information.  You can read line at a time or even the entire
file using that method.
